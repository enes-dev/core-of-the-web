        <h3>What Happened To HTML5 ?</h3>
        <p>
          HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content
          on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML version
          that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current
          specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.<a

        <h3>What About CSS3 ?</h3>
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
          describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
          such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
          Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the
          separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
          fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide
          more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
          characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
          specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces
          complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as
          enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
          between the pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation
          of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same
          markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such
          as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
          reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
          alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
          The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
          determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a
          particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The
          CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium
          (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use
          with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
          validation service for CSS documents.[5] In addition to HTML, other
          markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML,
          SVG, and XUL.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"

        <h3>So JavaScript ?</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a
          programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7]
          JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and
          multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
          prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
          Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of
          the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
          an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
          use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers
          have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm
          language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
          programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
          for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
          structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, ECMAScript
          itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking,
          storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a
          web browser) provides those APIs. JavaScript engines were originally
          used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers,
          usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of
          applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.
          Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including
          language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
          languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.<a
